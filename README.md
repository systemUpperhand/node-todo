3. Should be able to delete items
4. Should be able to edit items (Missing feature)
5. Must be able to deploy in docker (Missing feature)

### Tasks
1. Add missing requirement #4 to the application
2. Add sufficient test coverage to the application and update readme on howto run the tests
3. Add missing requirement #5 to the application (Dockerfile and update readme with instructions)

### Bonus
4. Display test coverage after tests are executed
5. Find and fix the XSS vulnerability in the application. Also make sure that it wont happen again by including a test.

> ### Notes
> - Update the code as needed and document what you have done in the readme below
> - Will be nice if you can git tag the tasks by number

Make sure the following modules are installed::

- 'npm install express'
- 'npm install body-parser'
- 'npm install helmet'
- 'npm install ejs'
- 'npm install istanbul'
- 'npm install mocha'


### Task 1:
Updates:
- back-end  - Added a post handler for edits which will  replace the existing item's value with the new value.
- front-end - Added style sheets to make UI more user friendly and change updated via a basic form post.  

### Task 2:
To run tests:
- 'npm install'
- 'npm test'

Updates:
- Added tests to test the API's responses for all 4 request types ('/todo', '/todo/add', '/todo/delete/:id', '/todo/edit/:id').

### Task 3:
Instructions:
- Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/.
- To build docker image: "docker build -t todo ."
- To run docker image: "docker run -p 81:81 -d todo"
- Navigate to 'http://localhost:81' to see the app running under docker.

Updates:
- Updated package.json to have the start script.
- Added the Dockerfile with instructions to run app.

### Task 4:
Instructions:
- 'npm install'
- 'npm test'

Updates:
- Added istanbul to add code coverage.
- Updated 'npm test' command to run tests and produce code coverage report.
- Added more tests to test all areas of app.js.
- Updated app.js to have better if checks inside of /todo/delete/:id and /todo/edit/:id to ensure that non-existant ToDos can't be removed or edited.

### Task 5:
Instructions:
- 'npm install'
- 'npm test'
- Enter '<script>alert("you have been hacked")</script>' into the ToDo list. No Popup should appear.
- Enter '<script>window.onload = function() {document.getElementById("newtodo").value = "You got hacked!";document.getElementById("new-submit").click();};</script>'.
The page should NOT add 'you have been hacked' to your ToDo list.
